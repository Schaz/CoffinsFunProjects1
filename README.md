Coffins Fun Projects #1, don't judge, we're not pros;

This is a project we make in the Cloudy Coffins. Anyone can join the project and help. This one is the first one, and later we will do more things. As I said up there, we are not pros, but we are learning to be better at this.

Anyone in need of experience or something like that to fill in their CV in order to get a job are welcome here, just tell me, message me. Help around a little and you can put this in your CV with description of what you did here. Here's my email: theos.chaos@gmail.com

Find a bug? Tell me! Hangout should do fine!
